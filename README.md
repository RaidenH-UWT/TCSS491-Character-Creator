# TCSS491 Character Creator

Web-based character creator built for extensibility


## TODO

- Write TOML spec for extensions

- Figure out if I can do user-end extensions; if I can let people upload extensions from the 
tool that would be really cool

- Go over the `GameEngine` base code and pick out useful parts
    - Need drag-n-drop functionality for things

- UI inside canvas? or outside?
    - i could do some cool stuff with UI animations inside the canvas, and would help me 
    learn to use it more
