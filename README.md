Web-based character creator built for extensibility


## TODO

- Go over the `GameEngine` base code and pick out useful parts
    - Need drag-n-drop functionality for things

- Decide whether the `picker` colorMode should allow the user to fully pick the color, or just
the hue (lets designers select colors more carefully, and hueshifting is a lot easier to do
without messing up black lineart than full color changing)

- Arrow buttons for moving assets precisely
